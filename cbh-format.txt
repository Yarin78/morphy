File contents
=============
This text file contains the result of many hours work trying to figure out how the Chessbase CBH file format (and related files) work. Some file extensions, such as the search booster and the archive format CBV, are completely ignored for now. All data was derived from ChessBase 9.0.

The following files contain the minimal game information in a database:

CBH - Game data (“H” is for game “header”). Contains the list of games in the database and pointers to location in the other files.
CBG - Game moves and variations
CBA - Annotations (text commentary)
CBP - Players index
CBT - Tournament index
CBC - Commentators index
CBS - Source index

Additional game information can be found in the following files.  If they are lost, information is irrevocably lost, but the games will still be fine.

CBE - Team index
CBJ - Secondary header file, team information, final material, type of rating
CBM - Multimedia baggage in HTML database text files.
CBL - Contains game titles in all languages

CBB/CBGI/CIT/CIP - Contains hashed information to speed up searches and retrievals. Recreated if lost.

More can be read about the file extensions here:
http://help.chessbase.com/Reader/12/Eng/index.html?filenames.htm



All strings are ISO-8859-1 encoded. Characters that doesn't exist in that encoding are simply stored as ?

Game setup format
-----------------
Ofs 0, Len 1 - Always 1?
Ofs 1, Len 1 - Bit 0-3: En passant file (0 = no en passant, 1 = a, 8 = h)
               Bit 4: 0=white to move, 1=black to move
Ofs 2, Len 1 - Bit 0: White O-O-O possible
               Bit 1: White O-O possible
               Bit 2: Black O-O-O possible
               Bit 3: Black O-O possible
Ofs 3, Len 1 - Next move number
Ofs 4, Len 24 - A 192 bit long variable length bit stream encodes the 32 squares on the board, a1-a8, b1-b8 etc.
                The piece codes are like this: (starting with MSB at ofs 4),

				0 = Empty square
				10001 = White king
				10010 = White queen
				10011 = White knight
				10100 = White bishop
				10101 = White rook
				10110 = White pawn
				11001 = Black king
				11010 = Black queen
				11011 = Black knight
				11100 = Black bishop
				11101 = Black rook
				11110 = Black pawn
Ofs 28 - Start of moves

The board is then scanned from a1 to a8, b1 to b8 etc. The first piece
of each type find is the initial first piece, etc (including pawns, of both colors).

Game data
=========
The moves in a game are represented as a stream of bytes. Most moves are represented as a single byte, describing the
relative movement of a piece. Pieces are described in terms such as "first rook" (meaning the rook that for white
starts on a1 and for black on a8), "second rook" etc.

When decoding the byte stream, first decrease the byte value with the number of moves so far processed in the game
data (minus 0 for the first move). The special codes for "multiple byte moves" and begin/end of variations don't count.
The move count should not be restarted when a variation end. Then translate the byte according to the
translation table below.

All pawn moments are seen from the point of view of the player to move. Pawn captures include en passant.

When a "first piece" is captured, the "second piece" becomes the new "first piece" for that player, and the
"third piece" becomes the "second piece". When a "second piece" is cpatured, the old "third piece" becomes the
"second piece". A "fourth piece" (or higher) never "promotes" and its movements are always represented with
multiple bytes. Pawns are never adjusted in this way, so the e-pawn remains as the "fifth pawn" throughout the game.

Multiple byte moves describes a move by denoting the start square and the destination square. This is done
with 6 bits each. Bit 0-5 in the second byte is the start square (a1=0, a2=1, h8=63), bit 6-7 in the second
byte and 0-3 in the first is the destination square. For pawn promotions, bit 4-5 is also used
(0=queen, 1=rook, 2=bishop, 3=knight). Any type of move can be described as a multipe byte move, but it's
typically only done when moving a fourth piece or doing a pawn promotion.

Single byte move translation table
----------------------------------
Note: These bytes look random, but they have actually been "encrypted" using a static array of 256 bytes that can be found at position 0x7AE4A8 in CBase9.exe and position 0x9D6530 in CBase10.exe (it starts with 0xAA, 0x49, 0x39, 0xD8, 0x5D, 0xC2, 0xB1, 0xB2). By reverse looking up these values, the new value will correspond to the order the are listed here.
